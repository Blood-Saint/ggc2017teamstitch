Crowd Wave is a 2d time management game where the player controls a mascot who must keep the energy of the crowd up to perform the “wave” when it reaches their part of the stadium. You must satisfy the crowd’s energy requirements before the wave gets to them or you’ll lose. If managing the energy of the crowd wasn’t enough, each successful completion of a wave causes the wave to speed up around the stadium. Oh no!
